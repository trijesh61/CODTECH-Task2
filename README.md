OBJECTIVE 
The objective of the Student Grade Tracker Python program is to provide a simple, user-friendly tool for managing and analyzing student grades. Specifically, the program aims to:

Collect and Manage Input: Allow users to enter multiple grades for various assignments or subjects. Validate input to ensure that it consists of numerical grades within a specified range (e.g., 0-100).

Calculate Average: Compute the average grade from the entered values to give an overview of academic performance.

Determine Letter Grade: Convert the average grade into a letter grade based on a predefined grading scale (e.g., A, B, C, D, F).

Compute GPA: Translate the average grade into a Grade Point Average (GPA) on a standard 4.0 scale.
